Poultry Disease Classification using Transfer Learning 
----------------------------------------------------- 

Description: 
------------- 
This internship project uses transfer learning to classify poultry diseases based on image data. Pre-trained deep learning models like ResNet50 and EfficientNet were fine-tuned to detect diseases such as Avian Influenza, Coccidiosis, and Newcastle Disease, or to classify poultry products as Healthy vs Rotten. 

Main Features: 
-------------- 
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras with pre-trained CNNs. 
- Classifies poultry images into Healthy or Rotten. 
- Flask web app for image upload and prediction. 
- Blog-style frontend to explain the project and share results.
